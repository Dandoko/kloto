## Remarks About Branching
- Remember to **use and push to your branch**, not the main branch
	- To be on your branch, `git checkout <user>Branch`
	- To push to your branch, `git push -u origin <user>Branch`
	- After pushing to your branch, submit a pull request to the main branch
		- Note: Pull requests can be done remotely through the GitHub website
- Remember to **pull from the main branch before starting on anything**
(programming, modelling, etc.) to minimize merge conflicts and to update your local
directory with changes someone else could have made
	- Change branches locally to the main branch by `git checkout main`
	- Pull from the remote GitHub repository by `git pull`
	- After pulling, change branches to your branch through `git checkout <user>Branch` 
	- In your branch, merge with the main branch by `git merge main`
	- After merging, `git push` immediately to have the branch on the remote repo be
	even with main
