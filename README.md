## Remarks About Branching
- Remember to use and push to your branch, not the main branch
	- To push to your branch, ```git push <user>Branch```
	- After pushing to your branch, submit a pull request to the main branch
	- Pull requests can be done remotely through the GitHub website
- Remember to pull from the main branch before starting on anything
(programming, modelling, etc.) to minimize merge conflicts
	- Change branches locally to the main branch by ```git checkout main``` and ```git pull```
	- After pulling, change branches to your branch through ```git checkout <user>Branch``` 
	- In your branch, merge with the main branch by ```git merge main```
	- After merging, ```git status``` to see the status of your branch
	- If asked after ```git status```, ```git push``` immediately to be even with main
