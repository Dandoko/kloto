# Kloto

## Project Description
Kloto is an FPS portal simulator made on the Unity game engine. Players can
explore two distinct maps through a first person perspective by teleporting
through existing portals or creating their own portals. Using a portal gun,
players can shoot on surfaces to create portals to teleport through.
